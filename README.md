In our project we have used a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to find the optimum gene subset in a number well studied dataset- Leukemia. By using three objectives for minimization-
Gene subset size
Number of misclassifications in training samples
Number of misclassifications in test samples
Â 
The dataset on which our project is based on is Leukemia gene expression dataset. It contains expression profiles of 72 leukemia samples. The dataset was divided into two groups: an initial training set of 27 samples of acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL) and 11 samples of acute myeloblastic leukemia(AML), and an independent test set of 20 ALL and 14 AML samples.
